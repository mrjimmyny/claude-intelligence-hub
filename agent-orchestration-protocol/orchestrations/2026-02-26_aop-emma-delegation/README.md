# AOP Task Delegation to Emma - Orchestration Report

**Orchestration ID:** `aop-emma-delegation-001`
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Pattern:** Delegated Execution & Monitoring

---

## 🎯 Objective

To correctly follow the Agent Orchestration Protocol (AOP) by delegating a task to an executor agent (Emma/codex) and monitoring for its successful completion. This corrects a previous deviation where the orchestrator performed the work itself.

The mission validates:
- **Strict Delegation:** The orchestrator's ability to dispatch tasks via shell commands as per AOP.
- **Active Vigilance:** The orchestrator's use of a polling mechanism to monitor for artifacts created by a background process.
- **Executor Reliability:** Emma's capacity to receive, parse, and execute a complex task delivered via CLI.

| **Artifact** | `C:\ai\_skills\...\00_plan-aop-v2-emma.md` |
| **Status** | ✅ SUCCESS (Verified by artifact) |

## 📊 Seven Pillars of AOP - Applied

| Pillar | Applied | Evidence |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **1. Environment Isolation** | ✅ | Emma was executed in an isolated `codex exec` subprocess, launched as a background task by the orchestrator. |
| **2. Absolute Referencing** | ✅ | The prompt delegated to Emma used full, absolute Windows paths for all files. |
| **3. Permission Bypass** | ✅ | The `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag was used in the `codex exec` command, as specified by the AOP for trusted execution. |
| **4. Active Vigilance** | ✅ | After dispatching the task, Forge entered a monitoring state, using `list_directory` to poll the filesystem for the expected artifact. |
| **5. Integrity Verification** | ✅ | Once the artifact `00_plan-aop-v2-emma.md` was detected, Forge used `read_file` to confirm it was not empty and contained the expected content structure. |
| **6. Closeout Protocol** | ✅ | This report serves as the orchestrator's explicit closeout signal, confirming the successful completion of the delegated task. |
| **7. Constraint Adaptation**| N/A | The orchestrator did not face constraints preventing it from monitoring the filesystem directly. |

## 🔧 Key Commands Used

### 1. Delegation to Emma (via PowerShell)

```powershell
Set-Location C:\ai; codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox 'Emma, this is a delegated task from Forge via AOP.

**Objective:**
Your task is to create a structured implementation plan.

**Instructions:**
1.  Read and fully understand the AOP contract document located at the absolute path: `C:\ai\_skills\agent-orchestration-protocol_d\v2\00_contract\03_contract-aop-v2-ciclope-final.md`.
2.  Next, read the deliverable instructions at the absolute path: `C:\ai\_skills\agent-orchestration-protocol_d\v2\01_plan\_deliverable01.md`.
3.  Based on those documents, create your implementation plan as requested. The plan must be organized into four specific stages: BUILD, TEST, VALIDATE, and AUDIT.
4.  You MUST save your final plan to this exact absolute path: `C:\ai\_skills\agent-orchestration-protocol_d\v2\01_plan\00_plan-aop-v2-emma.md`. Overwrite the file if it already exists.

**Confirmation:**
Upon successful creation of the file, your task is complete. No other output is required.'
```

### 2. Monitoring and Verification

```
# Polling for artifact creation
list_directory: C:\ai\_skills\agent-orchestration-protocol_d\v2\01_plan

# Verifying content after detection
read_file: C:\ai\_skills\agent-orchestration-protocol_d\v2\01_plan\00_plan-aop-v2-emma.md
```

| **Total Agents** | 2 (Forge, Emma) |
| **Commands by Forge** | 4 (`write_todos`, `run_shell_command`, `list_directory`, `read_file`) |
| **Artifacts Created** | 1 (`00_plan-aop-v2-emma.md`) |
| **Success Rate** | 100% |
| **Delegation Depth** | 1 |
| **Cross-LLM Coordination** | ✅ Gemini → OpenAI Codex |
| **Final Status** | ✅ SUCCESS |

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1.  **Strict Adherence to Protocol is Key:** The AOP is designed for predictable multi-agent systems. Following the delegation and monitoring patterns precisely ensures reliability and aligns with the operational framework.
2.  **Background Execution is Effective:** Launching executor agents as background processes is a valid strategy that frees the orchestrator to perform other tasks, such as monitoring.
3.  **Executor Autonomy Works:** Given a clear, well-structured prompt with absolute paths, the executor agent (Emma) was able to operate autonomously and successfully complete its task without further intervention.

---

## ✅ Validation

This orchestration validates:
1.  **Successful Task Delegation:** Forge can successfully dispatch a task to Emma using the `codex` CLI.
2.  **Reliable Monitoring:** The "Active Vigilance" polling strategy is effective for verifying the output of a background agent.
3.  **End-to-End AOP Flow:** The full cycle of Delegation -> Execution -> Monitoring -> Verification -> Reporting was completed successfully.

## 📦 Artifacts Generated

| File | Path | Author | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| **Emma's Plan** | `C:\ai\_skills\...\00_plan-aop-v2-emma.md` | Emma | AOP v2 Implementation Plan |

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESS**

This orchestration successfully demonstrates the correct application of the Agent Orchestration Protocol for delegating a task to an executor agent. The process was followed strictly, and the mission was completed successfully. This validates the AOP's delegation pattern and the reliability of the executor agent.
