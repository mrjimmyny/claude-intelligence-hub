# Codex Governance Framework
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Type:** Governance Documentation

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Institutional documentation bundle for deterministic governance of the codex bootstrap architecture. It defines structure, operating boundaries, and controlled next steps without changing runtime behavior by itself.

---

## 🏛️ Key Features
1. **Contract-Driven Architecture:** Explicit bootstrap modes (on, off, sync, audit, onboard).
2. **Release Discipline:** Semantic versioning with mandatory regression gates.
3. **Operational Transparency:** Playbook-based procedures for rollout and rollback.

---

## 📂 Framework Components
- `playbook/`: Operator-facing execution references and summaries.
- `planning/`: Institutional analysis and boundary documents.
- `next-steps/`: Deferred but contract-defined milestone documents.

---

## ⚠️ Maintenance
This is a documentation-only skill in the current phase. It does not activate runtime services automatically.

**Version History:**
- **v1.0.0** - Baseline institutional governance release.
