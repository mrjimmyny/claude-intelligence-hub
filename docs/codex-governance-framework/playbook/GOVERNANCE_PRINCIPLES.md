# Governance Principles

## Principle 1: Canonical Authority

HUB is the canonical source for governance contracts and core definitions.

## Principle 2: Deterministic Behavior

Given the same input and environment, the system must produce the same contract outcome.

## Principle 3: Fail-Closed Safety

If a required contract cannot be validated, execution must abort with an explicit contract code.

## Principle 4: No Silent Mutation

Mutating actions must be explicit, bounded, logged, and reviewable.

## Principle 5: Scope Discipline

A mission may only modify approved scope. Out-of-scope changes require a separate approval cycle.

## Principle 6: Governance Before Rollout

Release and compatibility governance must exist before broad operational rollout.

## Principle 7: Measurable Gates

Release and compliance decisions require measurable gates, not descriptive confidence.

## Principle 8: Operator Clarity

Rules must use simple language. Every operator action must map to explicit expected outcomes.

## Principle 9: Separation of Documentation and Activation

A documentation-orchestrator skill may exist before catalog activation. Activation is a separate governed change.

## Principle 10: Reproducibility

Validation, logs, and artifact verification must be repeatable and auditable across machines.
