### Executive Summary: Claude Code Session Resume IDs & Session Knowledge Registry

**Context:** We clarified what the Claude Code `--resume` session ID means and designed a robust, low-friction workflow to preserve "structural memory" (resume continuity) alongside existing "logical memory" skills in the `claude-intelligence-hub`.

**1. What `claude --resume <id>` means**
- The CLI prints a `--resume` command when a session is ended (e.g., via `exit`).
- Using `claude --resume <id>` restores that exact session context (conversation thread + working context), enabling deterministic continuation.
- This resume ID is infrastructure-level continuity and is complementary to any custom "session memory" documentation.

**2. Proposed solution: Session Knowledge Registry (Hub Skill)**
- Create a new skill under `claude-intelligence-hub` named `claude-session-registry.md`.
- The registry entry schema should capture, per session:
  - Date + Local Time (America/Sao_Paulo)
  - Resume Session ID
  - Git context (branch + last commit hash)
  - Project path
  - Tags (e.g., #BI, #MCP, #Refactor, #Architecture)
  - Concise summary (3–5 bullets)

**3. "Golden Close" protocol to avoid forgetting**
- Drop manual backfill workflows.
- Instead, enforce a behavioral guardrail: after completing any task/plan, Xavier must ask whether the session topics are finalized.
- If confirmed, Xavier must give an emphatic reminder to capture the resume ID after `exit` and trigger the registry flow right after resuming.

**4. Automation design direction**
- Prefer a flow where, after resuming, Xavier identifies the current session's resume ID (e.g., via `claude --list` / metadata) and writes the registry entry automatically.
- This minimizes manual friction: the user only needs to copy the resume command/ID temporarily and then request the registry update.

**5. Power Prompt (final) requirements**
- The Power Prompt must:
  - Specify the new hub skill file name (`claude-session-registry.md`).
  - Require Xavier to present **at least 3 approaches** first (pros/cons + best option). If fewer exist, state it explicitly.
  - Only after the user chooses an approach, Xavier produces a detailed Plan Mode plan.
  - Allow execution of bash/git/file commands **only after** user approval code: `GOEXEC`.

**Conclusion:** Resume IDs provide deterministic session continuation. A hub-level `claude-session-registry.md` skill plus an enforced "Golden Close" protocol yields a reliable, low-friction, audit-friendly session tracking system suitable for cross-platform Claude workflows.
