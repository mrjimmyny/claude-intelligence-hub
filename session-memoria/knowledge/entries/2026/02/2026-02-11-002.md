### Executive Summary: GitHub Security & LLM Integration

**Context:** Security assessment for public repositories (MIT License) managed via Claude Code/CLI.

**1. Public Repository Risks vs. Permissions**
- **Public Access:** Allows reading, cloning, forking, and opening issues/PRs.
- **Write Access:** Strictly restricted to the owner and authorized collaborators. Public status does **not** grant permission to delete, edit, or push code.
- **Primary Risk:** Exposure of secrets (tokens/keys) within the code, not the public visibility itself.

**2. 2FA & Passkeys Impact**
- **Human Access:** 2FA/Passkeys protect the web interface (GUI) login.
- **Machine/LLM Access:** Tools like Claude Code use Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or SSH Keys.
- **Compatibility:** Activating 2FA does **not** break Claude Code integration, as API/SSH authentication is decoupled from browser session 2FA.

**3. Security Best Practices**
- **Authentication:** Enable 2FA + Passkeys immediately for the main account.
- **Branch Protection:** Enable "Branch Protection Rules" for `main` to prevent accidental deletions or forced pushes.
- **Credential Hygiene:** Use unique SSH keys per machine and audit authorized OAuth Apps/Tokens regularly.

**Conclusion:** Public repositories are safe from unauthorized modification. 2FA is a mandatory security layer that does not interfere with AI-driven development workflows.
